# AskToYourDocs
AskToYourDocs is a sample application that demonstrates how to ask questions about your documents using the OpenAI API. 
If you're dealing with multiple projects and numerous technical documents for each project, you might find the need for 
a tool like AskToYourDocs, which simplifies the process of querying your documents.
# Why AskToYourDocs?
Managing multiple projects often involves sifting through a plethora of technical documents. AskToYourDocs streamlines 
this process by enabling you to ask questions directly to your documents. While various Python projects might explore 
similar concepts, many of these are tailored towards developers who are comfortable setting up their own environments.
# Made Using Chat GPT
This project is completely made using ChatGPT through prompt engineering. I didnt wrote a single 
line of code rather than some UI design and re-arrangement of code.
